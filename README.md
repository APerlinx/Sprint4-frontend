## Introduction

Trio is a pixel-perfect, end-to-end clone of Trello, a popular project and task management platform. Inspired by the functionality of Trello, Trio aims to provide a familiar and feature-rich experience for managing projects and tasks using a kanban board. This application offers a range of unique features in addition to Trello's core functionality, enhancing your project management experience.

## Main Features

- **Create and Manage Boards**: Use drag-and-drop functionality to effortlessly create, remove, and update lists and tasks on your boards.
- **Task Customization**: Customize tasks to the deepest level with options such as labels, due dates, members, cover images, checklists, activity logs, copying, moving, and archiving.
- **Side Menu**: Easily change the board's background using the Unsplash Photo API, filter tasks by members or labels, and access the general activity log.
- **Accessibility Features**: We've implemented a Blind Color Mode to aid users with color blindness and a voice assistant that accepts vocal commands for effortless task management.

## Technologies

Trio is built using the MERN stack:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing data.
- **Express**: A Node.js web application framework for building the server.
- **Vue**: A JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment for executing server-side JavaScript.
- **WebSockets**: Real-time board updates are achieved using WebSockets.
- **REST API**: Communication between the frontend and backend is facilitated using RESTful API calls.
